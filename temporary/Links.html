			<h2>Download Links</h2>
			<p>Various files that I've been asked to upload are linked here. I couldn't find sufficient free storage anywhere, so I'm using a roundabout way of storing them for free on Google Photos by tricking it that they're videos. You will need to click the link, and then click the options menu at the top right (3 dots) and press "Download all". Then you'll have to use <a href="GPStorage.zip">this AppleScript</a> to decode them after downloading. Please contact me if you have any questions, or if you want to laugh at me for storing stuff this way.
