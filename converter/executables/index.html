			<h2>Converting SWF files to executables</h2>
			<p><a class="button" href="/converter/">Back to Converter Page</a>

Once you convert your Scratch project to a SWF, you can convert it into a standalone application for your operating system! This guide will only cover converting to Windows and macOS applications, although it is also possible to do this for Android and Linux. <a href="/contact/">Contact me</a> if you have any trouble; this process can be a bit confusing.

</p>
			<h3>Downloading a standalone Flash Player</h3>
			<p>This conversion works by packaging your SWF file inside a Flash Player, just like your SWF is a Scratch project is packaged inside Scratch! So, you need to download a standalone Flash Player from <a href="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/installers/archive/fp_11.2.202.235_archive.zip">here</a>. Unzip/extract the file. Inside, you will find three folders, one ending in <i>32bit</i>, one ending in <i>64bit</i>, and one ending in <i>debug</i>. Choose the first one because it contains the standalone Flash Players. Now, continue to the section for your operating system for the actual packaging step.

</p>
			<h3>Converting to EXE</h3>
			<p>If you are on Windows, you will want to convert the SWF to an EXE file. Open the item called <i>flashplayer11_2r202_235_win_sa_32bit.exe</i> (32-bit standalone Flash Player 11 for Windows). Choose <i>File</i> > <i>Open</i>, press <i>Browse...</i>, and select the SWF file you want to convert. Then choose <i>File</i> > <i>Create Projector</i>. This will produce a Windows program containing your SWF.

</p>
			<h3>Converting to APP</h3>
			<p>If you use a Mac, you need to convert it to a macOS application. Open the <i>flashplayer11_2r202_235_mac_sa.app.zip</i> file, which will expand to an application called <i>Flash Player.app</i>. Open <i>Flash Player.app</i>, and choose <i>File</i> > <i>Open</i>. Select the SWF file that you want to convert. Then, choose <i>File</i> > <i>Create Projector</i> and save the converted macOS application.

Occasionally, when you open the Flash Player app on macOS, you might encounter an error that it is damaged or by an "unidentified developer". The easiest solution is to use the command line. Open Terminal, and type the following command:</p>
		<pre>cp -RX</pre>
		<p>
followed by a space. Now, drag the Flash Player app into the Terminal window. It should say something like this:</p>
		<pre>cp -RX /Users/junebeetle/Desktop/Flash\ Player.app</pre>
		<p>
Add a space and then type the output path, such as your Desktop:</p>
		<pre>cp -RX /Users/junebeetle/Desktop/Flash\ Player.app ~/Desktop/</pre>
		<p>
Press Enter, and it will copy the Flash Player to your Desktop, but leaving some metadata behind. This bypasses macOS's security and should allow you to open it as normal.</p>
