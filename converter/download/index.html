Press the button below to download the Scratch to SWF converter. This is recommended for more advanced users or people who want to use the converter offline. If you just want to try it out or convert a few projects, try the <a href="/converter/online/">online converter</a>.

<a class="button" href="/converter/download/Scratch%20Converter.zip">Download Converter and Source Code</a>

Some helpful people have translated the converter into different languages! Click one of the following links for more information:
- <a href="#chinese">Chinese Version</a>
- <a href="#korean">Korean Version</a>

Below is a rough history of the changes I made in each version.

			<h3>Converter v3.7 (Scratch v448)</h3>
			<p>- Hide default context menu items in projector
- Update Flex SDK link in build script dialog
- Build script automatically uses Apple JDK 1.6 (if present) to workaround error about 32-bit JVM
- Plus, a bonus <a class="button" href="/converter/download/Scratch%20Converter%20Hidden%20Cursor.zip">experimental version</a> that hides the cursor in the converted SWF, which can be useful.
