			<h2>Troubleshooting and Known Problems</h2>
			<p><a class="button" href="/converter/">Back to Converter Page</a>

If the converter isn't working for you, you're in the right place. It's far from perfect, and there are some things that might not work properly. Please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> if you've read this and you're still having trouble.

</p>
			<h3>The converter doesn't load or displays an error.</h3>
			<p>You may not have a working Flash Player. Try downloading it from <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer">here</a>. If you see an alert about a security risk or outdated Flash player, allow it to run.

</p>

			<h3>The converted file is an unknown type or can't open.</h3>
			<p>Make sure to save your file with a SWF extension so that your computer can tell what type of file it is. For example, name the project <i>Game.swf</i> when you save it. Once you do that, try opening it in a browser or a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html">standalone Flash Player</a> (download the <i>projector</i> version).

</p>
			<h3>Converted projects can't communicate with Scratch server.</h3>
			<p>Things such as the <i>username</i> block and Cloud Variables will not work. If you want to make a project that relies on these, it usually makes the most sense to share it on the Scratch website.

</p>
			<h3>Saving doesn't work in Chrome incognito mode.</h3>
			<p>Due to a bug in Google Chrome, if you try to use the converter in incognito mode, you can't save the converted SWF file. Please switch to a non-incognito window or a different browser.

</p>
			<h3>White screen while project loads.</h3>
			<p>Sometimes a converted project will show a white screen for a few seconds while the project loads, especially on slow connections or complex projects. If a project still doesn't load after a minute or so, you might be missing a Flash Player or experiencing a different bug (see below).

</p>
			<h3>White bar on the bottom or right side of the SWF.</h3>
			<p>The Scratch stage is a 4:3 ratio, which can't be easily changed. Please adjust the dimensions of the SWF file so the stage fits properly into the window.

</p>
			<h3>Converted projects don't load in newer versions of Flash Player.</h3>
			<p>Adobe has changed the security restrictions in Flash Player 23 and onwards. They basically prevent <i>local</i> SWF files (saved on your computer) from being able to use some Loader functions that Scratch needs. I can't workaround this, but you can bypass it by hosting your SWF file on a website or converting it to an application. This will bypass the security restriction by making the SWF no longer be a <i>local-with-network</i> file. See <a href="/converter/executables/">this page</a> for more info on converting SWF files to standalone executables for your platform.</p>
