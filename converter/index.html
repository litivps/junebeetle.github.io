      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>Hey Scratchers! Have you ever made a super awesome game, but the friend you wanted to send it to didn't have Scratch? Or, have you made a project that would be a really cool screensaver, but then you couldn't actually use it? Well, now you can do those things and much more, thanks to my Scratch to Flash converter. As you can probably tell from the name, it converts an SB or SB2 file to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a> SWF file. This allows you to run your Scratch projects offline, put them on your website, or send them to people who don't have Scratch installed. You can either use the <a href="http://junebeetle.github.io/converter/online/">online converter</a> or you can <a href="http://junebeetle.github.io/converter/download/">download</a> a copy of the program to use offline.

</p>
      <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
      <p>It is very simple. Open the <a href="http://junebeetle.github.io/converter/online/">online converter</a> page. You should see the program in the middle of the screen. Click "Open Scratch File" and browse for the project on your computer. Then, click "Convert to SWF". A dialog box should pop up asking to save the file. Type whatever name you want (be sure you add ".swf" at the end) and then click "save".

These instructions also apply to the downloadable version. Visit the <a href="http://junebeetle.github.io/converter/download/">downloads page</a> to get a copy. Then, you can simply extract the zip file and open "Converter.html".

</p>
      <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
      <p>If the converter isn't working for you, please try the following tips.

<b>The converter doesn't load.</b>
If you don't see anything, or you see an error message, you may not have a working Flash Player. Try downloading it from <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer">here</a>. If you see an alert about a security risk or outdated Flash player, just allow it to run. It is not dangerous and will not make any modifications to your computer.

<b>The SWF won't save.</b>
Are you using an incognito window in Google Chrome? If so, there is a bug which stops Flash from saving files. Switch to a standard window or a different browser.

<b>I can't open the SWF, or I get a file other than a SWF.</b>
If your computer is unable to find a program to open the SWF with, try using a browser. You can also download a standalone Flash Player; however, it is not usually necessary. Your computer already has a Flash plugin if you can use the converter. Also, be sure to save your file with a SWF extension. For example, name the project "Game.swf" when you save it. If the converted file is already on your computer, you can simply rename it so that it ends in ".swf".

<b>The SWF opens, but it doesn't work.</b>
This is the toughest problem to solve. First, ensure that you are converting a valid Scratch project. Try opening it with Scratch to see if it is corrupted. If it is an SB (Scratch 1.x) file, try opening it in Scratch 2 and then saving it again in the new SB2 format. Then, try converting the project with the default settings. Don't check any boxes or change the width and height. Updating your Flash Player or browser may also help.

<b>Something else.</b>
If these tips don't help you or you're having a problem not mentioned here, there's still a chance that I can figure it out. Why not <a href="http://junebeetle.github.io/contact/">contact me</a>?

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>When you play a Scratch game, the Scratch <i>interpreter</i>, a built-in part of both the Scratch website and the Offline Editor, runs the project's scripts. Although Scratch is based in Flash, the projects are never compiled to ActionScript code. Instead, the interpreter executes each block in the project by running the corresponding ActionScript functions. This converter doesn't actually compile the project to ActionScript either. It simply places it inside a copy of Scratch, along with a <i>loader</i>, a script which automatically reads the SB2 and tells Scratch to interpret it. It also controls any modifications you might have chosen, like hiding the green flag bar or turning on turbo mode by default. The combination of Scratch, the loader, and the project is called a <i>projector</i>. This is what your converted SWF file actually is.

</p>
      <h3>Known Problems</h3>
      <p>I'll be the first to admit that this is a work in progress and is far from perfect. If have read the troubleshooting advice and still can't get it to work, you may have found a bug. Please <a href="http://junebeetle.github.io/contact/">let me know</a>. Here are some of the larger issues that I already know about:

- Cloud variables don't work
- The username block doesn't work
- Due to a bug in Chrome, the online converter can't save SWFs in incognito mode
- There may be a 1-10 second white screen when opening the SWF
- There might sometimes be white bars on the bottom or right side of the window
- Converted projects are sometimes laggier than on the Scratch website
- The source code text files might not display properly on Windows (UNIX line endings)

Most of these problems aren't going to be fixed any time soon, as they are caused by limitations in Scratch or bugs in other software. I'll do my best, though.

</p>
      <h3>License</h3>
      <p>Since the converter contains a copy of Scratch to run the project, it must be licensed under the same <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GPL v2</a> license as Scratch. You can find the source code for my converter <a href="http://junebeetle.github.io/converter/download/">here</a> and the source code for Scratch <a href="https://github.com/LLK/scratch-flash/">here</a>.

The Scratch Team asked me to include the following message:</p>
